        29th Strategic Workshop 2026 (SW2026) on the theme ‘Global Digitization’ will be held in Rome, Italy during May 18-20.
      </p>
      <p class="home-intro">
        In an increasingly connected world, Global Digitization is reshaping the mode of operation, communication and innovation of societies. It has the potential to bridge gaps across geographies and promote inclusion in every sector from education to healthcare to governance. However, embracing this transformation necessitates addressing digital equity, data sovereignty, and ethical use of technology. The future of global digitization depends on collaboration between government, industry, and academia to ensure sustainable, secure, and accessible digital growth for all.
