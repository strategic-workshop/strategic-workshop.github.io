     Initiated by Professor Ramjee Prasad (Founder President, CTIF GLOBAL CAPSULE, Aalborg, Denmark), the Strategic Workshop (SW) is a well-established European forum that has brought together leading experts from academia, industry, and research organizations since its first edition in 1994 in Delft, the Netherlands. Over the years, it has traveled across Europe, providing a unique platform for open discussion, strategic thinking, and collaboration on the technologies shaping the wireless world.

      SW examines emerging areas such as 6G, the Internet of Things (IoT), and other next-generation wireless innovations, highlighting their role in driving economic growth, expanding digital inclusion, and transforming industries. With a strong focus on real-world impact, the workshop develops practical strategies for responsible and sustainable progress, addressing challenges in privacy, security, and future readiness, and exploring how wireless solutions can empower individuals, communities, and society at large.
